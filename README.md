# awesome-WM
WIP - all credits to JavaCafe01! I'm simply tweaking and redesigning aspects.

Since Wayland is not fully supported by some necessary porgrams, such as Zoom, RStudio & MatLab.
I am in the process of creating an alternative to my sway-WM to use those programs with xorg.

Features:
  - minimalistic Design
  - expandable sidebar to show information and contain shortcuts.


To-Do's:
  - creating matching icons for all processes
  - fine-tune shortcuts and controls as well as programs (rofi, etc)
